## D'Aboville

The d’Aboville system is a descending [genealogical numbering system](/genealogical-numbering-system/), as opposed to the ascending Sosa system, that traces family lines from a fixed ancestral point. Though less flexible than Sosa numbering, the d’Aboville system allows for the recording of all ancestors in a family, not just those in a direct line to a contemporary root. This is useful for going wide in a family’s history, whereas an ahnentafel is especially fit for going deep. The d’Aboville system is preferable to the similar Henry system for its legibility, and for the ease with which it handles families with ten or more children.

The d’Aboville groupings recorded on this site are structured around the root’s [seize quartiers](/seize-quartiers/), or sixteen great-great-grandparents, and their ancestors of the same family line. While traditionally used as a proof of nobility, these quartiers consist of farmers, and miners, and servants, and administrators, with no [quarters of nobility](/quarters-of-nobility/) to be found.

## Register

A surnames registry is an index of names intended to collect all ancestors with a given [surname](/surname/) in a straightforward, unified view, allowing for the tracing of direct lineages by said names. A surnames registry also has the benefit of making visible less prominent names in the ancestor table, surfacing those individuals that might otherwise go unnoticed. More generally, a surnames registry provides an opportunity for exploring the cultural and historical context of a given family name, which can help situate a specific root in their broader genealogical context.

The surnames registry on this site allows for research that goes beyond the familial record, making connections and providing context where gaps in the genealogy appear.
