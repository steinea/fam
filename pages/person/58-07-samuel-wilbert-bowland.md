#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-helen-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

I know nothing about Samuel, however, thanks to cousin Delores (Fitzpatrick) Pfeiffer, we have pictures of him. Delores visited his daughter Winnifred, who was kind enough to share her pictures. I can see a resemblance of my father’s looks with his uncle as younger men.

[(58) Thomas James Bowland](/58-thomas-james-bowland/) and [(59) Catherine Anderson](/59-catherine-anderson/) had seven children. [(29) Mary Elizabeth Bowland](/29-mary-elizabeth-bowland/) was their first born and Samuel Wilbert their last child, born October 20th, 1884.

He was married to Adeila Sherwood in July 1909 and made their home in Hampton, New Brunswick. They had four children - Sherwood (Sam), George, Winnifred and Alfred.

Samuel died August 4th, 1968 in Hampton and is buried at Mosher Hill Cemetery in St. Martin’s, New Brunswick. His wife died July 11th, 1973 and is also buried at Mosher Hill Cemetery.
