#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-helen-lorraine-fitzpatrick.) after reading letters [(12) Alfred Kirkham](/12-alfred-kirkham/) received from his second cousin Francis Albert 'Billy' Kirkham.*

George was the second and last child born to [(48) Richard Kirkham](/48-richard-kirkham/) and his second wife, [Elizabeth Rogers](/48-00-elizabeth-rogers/), on November 8th, 1873.

In correspondence received from Francis Albert “Billy” Kirkham, George’s name is mentioned several times.  Once recalling Billy visiting his Uncle Alfred’s store with his Dad and the men talking about George.  Another time referring to his betting on football games.

In one letter Billy asked, “Did George have any interest in wood?  He was very adept at carving - something wrong with the wrist on hand - only noticeable when being observed whilst working.”
