#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-helen-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

Rob, as he was called by the family, was the seventh and last child born to [(56) William Fitzpatrick](/56-william-fitzpatrick/) and [(57) Mary Fitzgibbons](/57-mary-fitzgibbons/), on May 29, 1892, in Saint John, New Brunswick.

The children of Rob’s brother [(28) John Thomas Fitzpatrick](/28-john-thomas-fitzpatrick/) always spoke very fondly of their Uncle Rob. Niece [Jessie Maitland Fitzpatrick](/28-01-jessie-maitland-fitzpatrick/) and nephew [(14) Frederick Francis Fitzpatrick](/14-frederick-francis-fitzpatrick/) visited Boston at least once and saw all the family that was living in Boston.

In a letter to Fred from his Uncle Rob, dated 1965, Rob laments not seeing the family in Western Canada, they being so far away.

Rob never married and was a very religious man. He earned his living as a meat cutter.

Referring to the Boston City Directories, starting from 1906, you can follow the living pattern of the different family members. John Thomas shares the same address as his mother Mary, widowed. Through this period, John is working in Boston and commuting to Saint John to his family. By 1924, Mary and Robert are living in Dorchester. In 1931, John, Robert and Mary are at the same address in Roxbury. They move back to Dorchester in 1932. Sister [Martha Fitzpatrick](/56-02-martha-fitzpatrick/), widowed, joins them in 1940. Robert is on his own, in retirement, in 1968.

Robert went to live at a monastery, St. Ann’s Church, 70 St. Stephen Street, in Boston, the final months of his life. He died July 2, 1970, and was buried in St. Joseph Cemetery in Section Cardinal O’Connell Lot.
