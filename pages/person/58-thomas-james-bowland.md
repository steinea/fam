#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-helen-lorraine-kirkham/).*

Although I had the privilege of seeing a picture of Thomas, the family shared very little about him with their children. It was my father, [(14) Frederick Francis Fitzpatrick](/14-frederick-francis-fitzpatrick/), Thomas’s grandson, who had the picture and kept it visible on his dresser. He would chuckle when we looked at the picture together and call him “Santa Claus,” because of his long white beard.

Thomas Bowland, son of [(116) Joseph Bowland](/116-joseph-bowland/), was born in Londonderry, Ireland. In 1837, while still a youth, he came to the colony (Canada) with his single father. There is no record of his mother. Although the 1851 census includes Thomas’s father Joseph as a mill man in St. John’s County, New Brunswick, they also located in Anderson Brook, near Walton Lake, King’s County, New Brunswick.

In King’s County, both the Walker Settlement (Walton Lake, Waterford) and Anderson Settlement (Hammond) were eleven and fourteen miles from Sussex. Londonderry (Anderson Settlement) was established as an Irish settlement in 1830. It is forty miles from Saint John.

In 1868, Thomas married [(59) Catherine Anderson](/59-catherine-anderson/), born June 24, 1844, of Walker Settlement. Catherine’s father and mother, [(118) Thompson Anderson](/118-thompson-anderson/) and [(119) Mary Anderson](/119-mary-anderson/), started life in Canada on the Walker Settlement, farming with brother-in-law Samuel, and Thompson’s sister Martha (Anderson) Walker. Catherine at seventeen years of age worked as a servant for the Wallace family. The Anderson’s later moved to Londonderry (Anderson Settlement).

At the time of his marriage, Thomas moved his wife Catherine to join him and his father Joseph in their home at Jeffries Corner, which is fifty-two miles from Saint John and eight miles from Sussex. Thomas did not sign his name on the marriage certificate. Instead he made an “X.”

Thomas was a great old grandpa to his grandchildren. They fondly remember him chopping down trees to plant potatoes around the stumps. He’d say “have to have my taters.”

Thomas was a staunch member of the Church of England, a life-long Liberal and he was the oldest living member of the Orange Order in New Brunswick. His wife Catherine died February 27, 1907, twenty-four years before Thomas, who died October 29, 1931, at the advanced age of 103 years. He was the oldest Orangeman in New Brunswick.
