#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-helen-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

Michael was the sixth child born to [(56) William Fitzpatrick](/56-william-fitzpatrick/) and [(57) Mary Fitzgibbons](/57-mary-fitzgibbons/), on February 10, 1887, in Saint John, New Brunswick.

Unlike his brother [Charles Fitzpatrick](/56-05-charles-fitzpatrick/), Michael did keep in touch with his family with reference to a letter uncle [Robert A. Fitzpatrick](/56-07-robert-a-fitzpatrick/) wrote to nephew [(14) Frederick Francis Fitzpatrick](/14-frederick-francis-fitzpatrick/) in 1965. He refers to Mike’s wife and daughter living in Boston, out in Roslindale and that he goes over to see them every Sunday.

Mike was a sign painter for Coca Cola in New York and that is where he died.
