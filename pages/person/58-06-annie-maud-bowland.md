#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-helen-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

Maud was the sixth child born to [(58) Thomas James Bowland](/58-thomas-james-bowland/) and [(59) Catherine Anderson](/59-catherine-anderson/) on April 23rd, 1880, on the farm at Jeffries Corner, Sussex, New Brunswick.

There are only a few things I can write about Aunt Maud. She traveled west to Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, twice during my growing up years. She had raised her niece [Dorothy Jean Fitzpatrick](/28-06-dorothy-jean-fitzpatrick/) and felt a close bond with all of her sister Mary’s children. Since she had no children of her own, and Mary died so young, Maud cared deeply. Although I was young when she visited Calgary, I remember her warmth and love. She was a very nice person with class.

Maud married Frederick Watson. They raised Dorothy Fitzpatrick from the age of fifteen and later [Audrey Heloise Fitzpatrick](/28-08-audrey-heloise-fitzpatrick/). When Dorothy married, she moved to Boston, Massachusetts. Audrey married in Saint John and moved west in the nineteen fifties.

Maud was widowed in September 1939 when her husband Fred died at the age of sixty-nine. In later years, she moved to Montreal where she died on December 13, 1963. Her body was brought back to Saint John, New Brunswick, by train for burial.
