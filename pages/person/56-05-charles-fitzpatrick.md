#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-helen-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

Charles was the fifth child born to [(56) William Fitzpatrick](/56-william-fitzpatrick/) and [(57) Mary Fitzgibbons](/57-mary-fitzgibbons/) on December 25, 1885, in Saint John, New Brunswick.

[Annie Catherine Fitzpatrick](/28-02-annie-catherine-fitzpatrick/) told me that he married a well to do woman but he obviously did not stay in touch with the family. They had no children. Apparently, he liked his drink too much.

She also said that he was a manager in the hotel industry like brother [William Louis Fitzpatrick](/56-04-william-louis-fitzpatrick/). In fact, they did manage a hotel together in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he died.

Charles was also a painter. Whereas William painted scenery, Charles painted animals.
