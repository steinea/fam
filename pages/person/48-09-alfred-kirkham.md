#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-helen-lorraine-fitzpatrick/) after reading letters [(12) Alfred Kirkham](/12-alfred-kirkham/) received from his second cousin Francis Albert 'Billy' Kirkham.*

Alfred Kirkham was [(48) Richard Kirkham](/48-richard-kirkham/)’s ninth child, but the first child with second wife [Elizabeth Rogers](/48-00-elizabeth-rogers/). He was born November 27, 1870, Foundry Street, Tipton, Staffordshire, England.

Alfred married Laura Griffin, Dec. 31, 1894. They had ten children:  Alfred, George, Wilfred, Horace, Laura, Albert, Lucy, Dennis, Elizabeth and Walter.

Billy Kirkham met Alfred, (his Dad’s uncle), at his father’s pub and when visiting Alfred’s General Store where Alfred was a butcher. A quote from Billy, “He used to amuse me. I visited his store many times in Greets Green. He had an ‘Off-Licence’ too”.

In the letters from Billy from 1972, Billy had received a letter from Mrs. Ann Pugh, a granddaughter of Alfred.
