#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-helen-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

Jessie, as she was known by the family, was the third child born to [(56) William Fitzpatrick](/56-william-fitzpatrick/) and [(57) Mary Fitzgibbons](/57-mary-fitzgibbons/) in 1875, in Saint John, New Brunswick.

The only thing passed down by [Annie Catherine Fitzpatrick](/28-02-annie-catherine-fitzpatrick/) about her Aunt Jessie is that she traveled with her father to Boston to visit Aunt Jessie, when she was seventeen or eighteen. It was between 1914 and 1918, the time of the First World War.
