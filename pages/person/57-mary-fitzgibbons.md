#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-helen-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

Mary Fitzgibbons was born to [(114) William Fitzgibbons](/114-william-fitzgibbons/) and [(115) Anastasia Foran](/115-anastasia-foran/) and was baptized September 4th, 1850 in St. John’s, Newfoundland. The officiating priest was Rev. Father John Donnell and the sponsors were Daniel Murphy and Mary Viscount.

There is very little information about this family apart from what we have found on census records, etc. For example, Mary’s parents were both born in Ireland. William in 1823 and Anastasia August 14, 1830.

Mary’s father William was a seaman and sailed between Belfast, Ireland and St. John’s, Newfoundland. The 1901 census states that Anastasia came to Canada in 1849, which indicates William brought his bride over.

William and Anastasia obviously had more children than Mary. The 1871 Census for Halifax, N. S. lists a daughter [Johanah Fitzgibbons](/114-01-johanah-fitzgibbons) (possibly Annie) age 25 and a son [William Fitzgibbons](/114-02-william-fitzgibbons/) age 21, both born in Newfoundland. On the same census form it is noted that Anastasia could not read or write. Also, it would appear that Johanah was widowed and was left with a three year old daughter named Mary Ann McRey.

The 1881 Census for Saint John, N. B., Prince Ward, William, Anastasia and a seventy year old female by the name of Hanora Doran are all registered at the same address. Although Hanora Doran’s occupation is listed as servant, one could speculate that she was the mother of Anastasia and living with her daughter’s family.

William Fitzgibbons died in 1887 or 1888. On the 1901 Census, Anastasia is listed living with her daughter Mary and son-in-law William Fitzpatrick. Anastasia died April 21, 1902 in Saint John, New Brunswick and was buried in St. Joseph’s Cemetery.
