#### Biography

*Written by [(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick](/7-helen-lorraine-fitzpatrick/).*

Mattie, as she was called by the family, was the second child born to [(56) William Fitzpatrick](/56-william-fitzpatrick/) and [(57) Mary Fitzgibbons](/57-mary-fitzgibbons/), in 1874, in Saint John, New Brunswick.

There is very little known about Mattie. However, we do have a nice picture of her and know that she lived in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A., as did her widowed mother and her three brothers [(28) John Thomas Fitzpatrick](/28-john-thomas-fitzpatrick/), [William Louis Fitzpatrick](/56-04-william-louis-fitzpatrick/), and [Robert A. Fitzpatrick](/56-07-robert-a-fitzpatrick/).

My husband Bert and I made a trip to Boston, in 1985, and visited the Registry of Vital Records and Statistics. At this time, the information we were able to obtain helped us locate where she was buried at time of death and made a copy of her death certificate.

Mattie was married to Alex Nye and at the time of her death she was living at 249 Washington Street.

She died December 2nd, 1945, at the Boston City Hospital, and was buried in Mt. Benedict Cemetery.
